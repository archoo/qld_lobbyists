inspired by mlandauer 

who was in turn inspired by http://foi-privacy.blogspot.com/2009/12/victorian-lobbyists-up-in-lights-nsw.html

done on windows using..
- python
- sqlite3
- xpdf tools

once you have checked it out run these commands in order..
- md assets
- md data
- download_pdfs.py
- for %p in (assets/*.pdf) do pdftotext -layout %p
- parse_pdfs.py
- build_db.py

you should end up with..
- pdfs & text in assets folder
- csvs in the data folder
- qld_lobbyists.db in project folder

enjoy..
